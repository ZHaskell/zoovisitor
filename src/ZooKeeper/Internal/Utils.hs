-- | A 'Resource' is an 'IO' action which acquires some resource of type a and
-- also returns a finalizer of type IO () that releases the resource.
--
-- The only safe way to use a 'Resource' is 'withResource' and 'withResource'',
-- You should not use the 'acquire' field directly, unless you want to implement
-- your own resource management. In the later case, you should 'mask_' 'acquire'
-- since some resource initializations may assume async exceptions are masked.
--
-- 'MonadIO' instance is provided so that you can lift 'IO' computation inside
-- 'Resource', this is convenient for propagating 'Resource' around since many
-- 'IO' computations carry finalizers.
